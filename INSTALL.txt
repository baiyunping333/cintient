[ REQUIREMENTS ]
1. Apache HTTPD (or your other webserver of choice)

2. PHP 5.3.x


[ INSTALLATION ]
1. For now just configure a vhost in your webserver to handle this. Try the
   following for starters:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot /servers/cintient/www
      ServerName cintient.localsite.com
      ErrorLog /var/log/httpd.error
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteRule ^(?!/js/)(.*)$ /WebHandler.php [L]
      php_value include_path /servers/cintient
      <Directory "/servers/cintient/www">
          Options FollowSymLinks
          AllowOverride FileInfo
          Order allow,deny
          Allow from all
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  
2. As for PHP, no special configuration is required - for now!

3. Open up src/config/config.php and change what you must - we still don't have
   an automatic process for this. Make sure pretty much all dirs specified there
   have the proper writing and execution permissions for your webserver process
   that will be running Cintient. 

4. Locate src/core/TemplateManager.php's method install() and within it make
   sure you specify your root account and password. This will be used for your
   first access into the platform.


[ STARTUP ]
1. Access your configured vhost:

  http://cintient.localsite.com/install

  This starts up Cintient on your local setup, installs the database and sets
  up the starting tables. You should only run this the first time 'round.
  
2. Enter the platform with the credentials you provided in the install() method.

3. Have fun taking it up for a ride. Wanna join us? We need your contribution!
