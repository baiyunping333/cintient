1. INTRODUCTION

Cintient is a Continuous Integration web application written in PHP. It
was written to be simple to setup and straightforward to use - with
special attention to UI - in order to bring CI practices to most small
to medium projects that just don't justify the setup of a more complex
CI solution.

Cintient is portuguese software, made passionately in fine Portugal.

What Cintient does not do/have:
 . distributed builds (master/slave)
 . +10.000 plugins to do every single imaginable task
 . fugly UI
 
What Cintient does/has:
 . easy one-time setup of the application (1 minute)
 . visual edition for builder tasks, i.e., no messing around with Ant
   XML sources or any other, in order to configure your project builds
 . PHP syntax checking tasks
 . PHPUnit integration for unit testing
 . PHPDepend for quality metrics
 . PHPCodeSniffer for coding standards enforcement
 . Code coverage support (PHP Xdebug extension required)
 . Perl syntax check (just so you know you can add support to pretty
   much every language you want)
 . sexy looks... O:-)
    
What's planned for the future (in no specific order):
 . Git support
 . Trends and history charts for pretty much all collected metrics
 . Packaging and [simple] deployment flows
 . PHP code browser with contextual information (syntax errors, etc)
 . PHP documentation generation
 . MySQL support (possibly...)
 . Notifications system
 . ...



2. REQUIREMENTS

We tried to go easy on the requirements. These are what you absolutely
need in order to successfully install and start using Cintient:
 . PHP 5.3.0 or better
 . Apache HTTPD with mod_rewrite
 . PHP with sqlite3 version 2.5 or better
 . PHP with GD (with PNG and FreeType) - we're working on removing this
   requirement completely from the list.
 . [Optional] Xdebug (for PHP code coverage support)



3. INSTALLATION
3.1. EASY INSTALLATION - (RECOMMENDED)

Check the requirements above. You need them in order to perform an easy
install. Go through the following steps:
 1 .  Your web server's configuration must allow you to specify per
      directory .htaccess files and mod_rewrite directives within them.
      For this you need to have at least "AllowOverride FileInfo". Also,
      enable "Options Indexes" and "DirectoryIndex index.php". If you've
      changed these just now, don't forget to restart your Apache
      server. 
 2 .  Open up a browser window, navigate to the directory where you
      unpacked Cintient. You should see the installer coming up.
 3 .  Follow the instructions. It should only take you a minute to
      finish.



3.2. MANUAL INSTALLATION

4. CONTRIBUTIONS

If you're willing to contribute, there's many ways to go about it. The
prefered would probably mean jumping in on the developers mailing list
(cintient-developers@googlegroups.com) and getting acquainted. It would
also probably mean you checking out the sources and providing some
patches, on that list. If you really want to contribute but really have
no idea what to do, there's no harm in asking.

Anyway, I'm guessing that if enough people use Cintient, they will
probably miss a task or two, and probably will get around to actually
contribute them. Anyway you see it, just come on the mailing list and
get yourself known.
